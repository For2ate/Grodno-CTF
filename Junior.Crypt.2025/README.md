These tasks are my first experience as a task author. All of them are classic. They are designed for beginner and intermediate level participants. I'll try to make the tasks more complicated and interesting for the next CTF. I'd be grateful if you shared your impressions and recommendations. Tell me about tasks you would like to see in the future.
